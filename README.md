# Genitic-Algorithm

Genetic algorithm was developed by Goldberg which was inspired from Darwin's theory of evolution. It states that the survival of an organism is affected by the rule "**Survival of the Fittest**". Darwin also stated that the survival of an organism can be maintained through the process of reproduction, which consists of three parts which are natural selection, crossover and mutation. Darwin's concept of evolution is then adapted to computational algorithms to simulate the procreation and propagation of a certain species. Three different simulations have been made and then their results were recorded. First simulation is **Deterministic**, where everything is decided beforehand. There is little to no randomness involved in this process. Second one is **Non-Deterministic**, where everything is random and a good variation graph is obtained. Third one is **Natural Selection**, it is the same as non-deterministic but the process of natural selection is added in this simulation, which is the replica of the procreation process subconsciously followed in real life.
